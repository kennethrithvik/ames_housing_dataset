# Ames Housing Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house sale prices based on detailed property characteristics and location features from Ames, Iowa (2006â€“2010). The dataset provides rich information including lot dimensions, building type, neighborhood, quality ratings, and sale conditions.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

The dataset contains 2,930 residential property transactions with over 80 features covering:

- **Property structure**: square footage, quality, condition, year built/remodeled  
- **Lot details**: size, shape, zoning, slope  
- **Neighborhood and location**  
- **Amenity indicators**: fireplaces, garage, pool, porches  
- **Sale details**: date, price, sale condition

## ðŸ§  Objectives

- Predict house sale prices with a focus on **accuracy and interpretability**  
- Identify **key drivers** of property value  
- Understand **where and why the model performs well or poorly**  
- Build a reproducible and transparent modeling pipeline

## ðŸš€ Usage

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run notebooks inside `notebooks/` directory:
   - `1_EDA.ipynb` for exploration
   - `training_prediction.ipynb` for model development
